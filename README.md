# Image_Captioning
Image caption generation has emerged as a challenging and important research area following advances in statistical language modelling and image recognition. The generation of captions from images has various practical  benefits, ranging from aiding the visually impaired, to enabling the automatic and cost-saving labelling of the millions of the images uploaded to the internet every day. The field also brings together state-of-the-art models in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, two of the major fields in Artificial Intelligence. In this model, we has used CNN and LSTM to generate captions for the images and deployed our  model using Flask.
